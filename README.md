# 💸 Expense Tracker Project

An interactive and user-friendly Python program to help users track their monthly income, expenses, savings, and overall financial health. Built as a simple financial advisor, this tool helps users set savings goals and monitor progress. This beginner program is an assignment project assigned by my course instructor for the "AI & Data Science" course at Saylani Mass IT Training (SMIT) institute.
